# ahsanayaz

Having your own package is sometimes fun.

Turned it into a business card which is highly inspired by [bitandbang](https://twitter.com/bitandbang)'s idea he [shared on twitter](https://twitter.com/bitandbang/status/1075473070368919552).

Usage of `colorette` inspired by [mhartingtong](https://github.com/mhartington) because of zero dependencies.

Run below from your terminal.
```bash
npx ahsanayaz
```
